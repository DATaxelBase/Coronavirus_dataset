The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of 11 March 2020, over 126,000 cases have been confirmed in more than 110 countries and territories, with major outbreaks in mainland China, Italy, South Korea, and Iran. More than 4,600 have died from the disease and 67,000 have recovered.This dataset has information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus.
What about the new stats ? Everybody live now with Coronavirus. I decide to automate scraping for all data per month in order to build consistent analysis and then compare the results of current years with those of 2019. Please note that this data was scrapped from [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC. 
2022 Number of mutations of Coronavirus under a certain number of variant. But fortunately with vaccination applied there is a real decreasing of amount of positive cases. However the disease still present. The data will tell us the current situation on global view.
